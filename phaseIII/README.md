# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, our team conducted a user study to test the usability of our SmartInsulin mobile application prototype. The prototype was refined based on insights from the earlier phases, and this final evaluation focused on how well users could navigate its core features. We observed how participants interacted with the prototype in simulated real-world scenarios, with the goal of identifying areas for improvement before finalizing the design.

## Methods

To evaluate the usability of our SmartInsulin prototype, we conducted a structured user study simulating realistic scenarios for individuals managing Type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the study was to identify usability strengths and pain points across key features of the interface, interactions, and flows, such as setup, data sharing, note logging, trend analysis, and caregiver support.

This was a formative usability study, designed to inform design decisions while the prototype is still evolving. We used the think-aloud protocol, where participants verbalized their thoughts, reactions, and confusion while performing tasks. This method allowed us to gain insight into user decision-making, expectations, and perceptions of ease-of-use.

The study included three parts:

1. Preliminary questions to understand user background and expectations, which forked into two separate paths based on each user's answer to the initial question
2. Six task-based scenarios that reflect real-world use cases of the SmartInsulin app
3. Post-task questions in which participants were asked to reflect on their experience with the prototype

Task 1 aimed to test the onboarding experience, clarity of instructions, and overall ease of initial configuration.\
Task 2 aimed to evaluate the discoverability and usability of the export/share feature, as well as trust in the report’s formatting.\
Task 3 aimed to assess flexibility in logging contextual information and the intuitiveness of manual input.\
Task 4 aimed to examine the usability and usefulness of AI-driven interaction, as well as trust in health-related answers.\
Task 5 aimed to evaluate the readability of data visualizations, the layout of insights, and user comprehension of trends.\
Task 6 aimed to test multi-user support, caregiver access, and clarity of information in a remote monitoring context.

We recorded participants’ behavior, task success, and post-task feedback, including:
- Comments users offered as they were thinking aloud
- Whether they completed the task
- A self-reported difficulty score (1 = Very Difficult, 5 = Very Easy)
- Open-ended responses explaining their experience

The post-task debrief questions helped us identify unmet expectations, areas for improvement, and overall user sentiment.

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
