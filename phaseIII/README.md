# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III, our team conducted a user study to test the usability of our SmartInsulin mobile prototype. The prototype was refined based on insights from the earlier phases, and this final evaluation focused on how well users could navigate its core features. We observed how participants interacted with the app in simulated real-world scenarios, with the goal of identifying areas for improvement before finalizing the design.

## Methods

To evaluate the usability of our SmartInsulin prototype, we conducted a structured user study simulating realistic scenarios for individuals managing Type 2 diabetes. The purpose of the study was to identify usability strengths and pain points across key features of the app, such as setup, data sharing, note logging, trend analysis, and caregiver support.

This was a formative usability study, designed to inform design decisions while the prototype is still evolving. We used the think-aloud protocol, where participants verbalized their thoughts, reactions, and confusion while performing tasks. This method allowed us to gain insight into user decision-making, expectations, and perceptions of ease-of-use.

The study included two parts:

1. Preliminary questions to understand user background and expectations
2. Six task-based scenarios that reflect real-world use cases of the SmartInsulin app

We recorded participantsâ€™ behavior, task success, and post-task feedback, including:
- Whether they completed the task
- A self-reported difficulty score (1 = Very Difficult, 5 = Very Easy)
- Open-ended responses explaining their experience

**Preliminary Questions**
We began by asking participants about their familiarity with diabetes management. Based on their answer to the initial question, we followed two separate paths:

> **Q: Are you currently managing diabetes for yourself or someone else?**


## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
