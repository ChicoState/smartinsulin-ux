# Smart Insulin

Managing Type 2 diabetes can be tricky because patients need to take the right amount of insulin at the right time. If they take too much or too little, it can lead to serious health problems. Right now, many people rely on manual calculations or guesswork, which isn't always accurate.

Our project aims to make insulin delivery smarter and easier by using a Raspberry Pi (a small computer) and machine learning. Instead of relying on real-time sensors, we use historical data (past glucose and insulin records) to predict how much insulin a person needs. The Raspberry Pi will then control a small pump to automatically deliver the right amount of insulin (using water in our prototype).

Many individuals with Type 2 diabetes face challenges in determining the correct insulin dosage, as it depends on factors like food intake, physical activity, and overall health. Delays in administering insulin can result in dangerous fluctuations in blood sugar levels, leading to sudden spikes or crashes. Additionally, the risk of miscalculating the dosage, whether too much or too little, can cause serious health complications, making effective diabetes management both difficult and crucial.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* **More Than Just a Device** – This isn’t just an insulin pump; users can also ask ChatGPT health-related questions like “How much sugar is in a Pink Lady apple?” to make smarter food choices and feel more in control of their glucose levels.
* **Mood Diary for Tracking Well-Being** – Users can log how they’re feeling in a built-in mood diary, helping them track emotional and physical patterns related to their diabetes management.
* **Smarter Insulin Predictions** – Our system analyzes past data to better predict how much insulin a person needs, reducing the chances of incorrect dosing.
* **Less Work for Patients** – Automated insulin delivery means fewer manual calculations and adjustments, making life easier for users.
* **Prototype is in Progress!** – We’ve purchased the necessary equipment and are actively working on building the system to control the insulin pump (simulated with water).
* **Personalized for Each Person** – The system learns from each patient’s unique patterns, ensuring insulin delivery is tailored to their specific needs.
* **A Step Toward Better Diabetes Care** – This project highlights how AI and automation can make managing diabetes safer, simpler, and more effective in the future.
