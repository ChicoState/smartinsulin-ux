![Eliza Miller](ElizaMiller.png)

Name: Eliza Miller 
Age & location:16-year-old teen athlete in San Fransisco, California
Occupation: High school student, soccer player

Emily loves playing soccer, hanging out with friends, and watching highlights of her favorite athletes. She’s always looking for ways to improve her game, whether through training drills or studying professional players’ techniques. She dreams of playing soccer in college and is already looking at potential schools with strong athletic programs.

She enjoys the freedom of being a teenager but sometimes feels like her diabetes sets her apart. She was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at 12, and while she’s used to managing it, she gets frustrated when she has to stop mid-game to check her glucose levels. She doesn’t want her condition to define her, and she definitely doesn’t want to be seen as the girl with diabetes.

**Goals:**
* Keep her blood sugar stable without disrupting her training
* Find ways to make diabetes management feel effortless and discreet
* Connect with other athletes who also manage diabetes.

![Tyler Washington](TylerWashington.png)

Name: Tyler Washington
Age: 46
Married with two kids, Jenna (12) and Markus (8). Jenna was born with Type I diabetes.

Tyler’s wife, Angela, is often out of town for work. Tyler is a field technician for the local branch of a major insurance company. He travels locally, but keeps his phone on him. His wife, Angela, uses her phone regularly, but is not a super-user of any of the applications she uses heavily.

Tyler is willing to learn new programs, but can grow frustrated if it takes too long, or if the documentation is not comprehensive or easily searchable. He wants to spend his free time with his family, not reading instruction manuals.

Jenna’s middle school is near their house, but Tyler is often more than a 30-minute drive away. Currently, Jenna uses an older glucose-monitoring and insulin-delivery system, with blood testing and a waist-pack. The school nurse helps keep track of Jenna’s insulin deliveries and glucose levels while she’s at school. If something were to happen to Jenna, the school would call Tyler. However, he worries often about Jenna, or if the school were to call the house phone instead of his cell phone. He’d like the peace of mind of being able to check on Jenna’s glucose levels himself throughout the day to ensure that his daughter his healthy and safe, but Jenna’s current diabetes management doesn’t have features for that.

# Scenarios

**James Walker**
As a visually impaired accountant, James spends long hours working on spreadsheets and financial reports using a screen reader. He needs his smart insulin pump to seamlessly integrate with his assistive technology so he can manage his diabetes without disrupting his workflow.

During work, James receives a discreet voice alert through his Bluetooth earpiece when his blood sugar is dropping. Instead of fumbling with buttons or a small screen, he uses voice commands to check his glucose levels and confirm an insulin dose. If an urgent alert arises, the pump vibrates on his waist, ensuring he never misses critical notifications.

Later, while commuting home, James relies on haptic feedback from his smartwatch to monitor his glucose levels without needing to stop and check his phone. His smart insulin pump automatically adjusts his insulin dose based on real-time data, giving him peace of mind that his diabetes is under control—even when he can’t see the numbers.

**Eliza Miller**
It’s a game day and Eliza is locked in and ready to play. During warm-ups, her insulin device indicates a basal reduction because her glucose is trending low. She eats a quick snack and hits to the field. 

Mid-game, she was she sprints for a goal, and her CGM detects a spike in glucose. Without her having to do anything, Omnipod adjusts her insulin to keep her in range. After the win, she heads out for dinner with her teammates. Her Omnipod app calculates her bolus for the meal, so she can focus on celebrating, not her diabetes.

**Tyler Washington**
Tyler’s job has taken him to the outer edge of his range of his service area, a two-hour drive away from Jenna’s school. Jenna wasn’t very hungry at breakfast today, and while he insisted she eat, he’s worried that her glucose levels will fluctuate more heavily today, and that she may start to feel unwell before her recess monitoring. She has fainted before, and it’s always a harrowing experience. He’d like the reassurance of her glucose levels being more closely monitored today, and/or to be able to check them himself.

With the smartinsulin product, Tyler can pull his phone out and open up the connected app. He can see immediately Jenna’s current glucose level, whether it’s too high or too low, and the next planned injection according to her insulin-administration plan. If Jenna needs attention outside of her planned schedule, Tyler knows that an alert will be sent to him, and another will be sent to the school nurse so that actions may be taken accordingly.
