# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our project is focused on solving the challenges people with Type 2 diabetes face when managing their insulin levels. Many patients struggle with getting the right amount of insulin at the right time, which can lead to serious health issues. In Phase I, we spent time understanding what users really need, looking at other products on the market, and creating early designs for our system. We wanted to make sure that our solution isn’t just about delivering insulin, but also personalized to each patient’s needs, while offering features like a mood diary and health-related support through ChatGPT.

## Methods

One of our initial methods in approaching the UX/UI design process for our project was the development of personas and scenarios. Each member of the team sought to generate a persona targeting different aspects of potential users. Each member then generated a scenario to pair with their constructed persona, in which the persona would have cause to utilize our product. Personas and scenarios are intended to aid the project team in empathizing with potential users.

   In identifying competitors both for the competitive and heuristic analyses, we utilized prior knowledge and Google searches, as well as comparison charts produced by competitors on their product information pages, to generate our list of competitors and identify the competitor best suited for deeper analysis.
   
   Once our competitor list was established, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of three key insulin management devices: Omnipod 5, t: slim X2, and MiniMed 780G. We examined their functionality, usability, sensor accuracy, failure points, and integration with mobile apps. This analysis provided insights into market gaps, helping us understand how existing solutions handle insulin dosing, monitoring, and patient interaction.
   
   Our team conducted a heuristic evaluation on what we deemed, based on analysis of the product and features in comparison to planned features for our own product, to be our closest competitor: the Omnipod 5. Utilizing Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics, we scored the Omnipod 5 on a 1-10 scale for the following categories: Visibility of System Status; Match between system and the real world; User control and freedom; Consistency and standards; Error prevention; Recognition rather than recall; Flexibility and efficiency of use; Aesthetic and minimalist design; Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors; and Help and documentation. We then explained the reasoning behind our scoring for each of the criteria.

  
## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

1. Personas and Scenarios:
   !!! findings here !!!
2. Competitive Analysis:
    Our findings highlighted that while current devices effectively manage insulin delivery, they often lack personalization and seamless integration with digital health support tools, which are crucial for helping patients manage their insulin levels more effectively. Additionally, we examined cost-related barriers and accessibility challenges, ensuring our system provides a more affordable and user-friendly alternative. This helped us pinpoint areas where innovation is needed, shaping the direction of our solution towards a more personalized, AI-enhanced system for Type 2 diabetes management.
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Our heuristic evaluation identified the following heuristic categories as pain points (scored 7 or lower out of 10) for the Omnipod 5: User control and freedom; Consistency and standards; Error prevention; and Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. For the remaining categories, the Omnipod 5 scored 8 or higher.

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!

1. Personas and Scenarios:
   Our personas and scenarios were not data-driven, and thus have some limitations in how much  they may be representative of actual subsets of potential users. 
2. Competitive Analysis:
   !!! Caveats here !!!
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Our heuristic evaluation competitor was chosen from a shortlist that our team generated based on our, admittedly limited, prior knowledge of diabetes management devices, as well as extrapolated from competitor comparisons provided by some of our identified competitors. With no direct access to an Omnipod 5 for working with it to better understand it, our heuristic evaluation was based on what we could gather from product pages and some Google-based research into product reviews and user-identified pain points mentioned in product reviews.
