# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our project is focused on solving the challenges people with Type 2 diabetes face when managing their insulin levels. Many patients struggle with getting the right amount of insulin at the right time, which can lead to serious health issues. In Phase I, we spent time understanding what users really need, looking at other products on the market, and creating early designs for our system. We wanted to make sure that our solution isn’t just about delivering insulin, but also personalized to each patient’s needs, while offering features like a mood diary and health-related support through ChatGPT.

2. Competitive Analysis:
   To gain insights into existing insulin management solutions, we conducted a competitive analysis by systematically evaluating key products in the market, including Omnipod 5, t: slim X2, and MiniMed 780G. This method involved gathering data from product specifications, user reviews, and manufacturer documentation to assess functionality, accuracy, user experience, cost, and technological integration. Our findings highlighted that while current devices effectively manage insulin delivery, they often lack personalization and seamless integration with digital health support tools, which are crucial for helping patients manage their insulin levels more effectively. Additionally, we examined cost-related barriers and accessibility challenges, ensuring our system provides a more affordable and user-friendly alternative. This helped us pinpoint areas where innovation is needed, shaping the direction of our solution towards a more personalized, AI-enhanced system for Type 2 diabetes management.
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Our heuristic evaluation identified the following heuristic categories as pain points (scored 7 or lower out of 10) for the Omnipod 5: User control and freedom; Consistency and standards; Error prevention; and Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. For the remaining categories, the Omnipod 5 scored 8 or higher.
