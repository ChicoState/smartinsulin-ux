# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

Our project is focused on solving the challenges people with Type 2 diabetes face when managing their insulin levels. Many patients struggle with getting the right amount of insulin at the right time, which can lead to serious health issues. In Phase I, we spent time understanding what users really need, looking at other products on the market, and creating early designs for our system. We wanted to make sure that our solution isn’t just about delivering insulin, but also personalized to each patient’s needs, while offering features like a mood diary and health-related support through ChatGPT.

## Methods

One of our initial methods in approaching the UX/UI design process for our project was the development of personas and scenarios. Each member of the team sought to generate a persona targeting different aspects of potential users. Each member then generated a scenario to pair with their constructed persona, in which the persona would have cause to utilize our product. Personas and scenarios are intended to aid the project team in empathizing with potential users.

   In identifying competitors both for the competitive and heuristic analyses, we utilized prior knowledge and Google searches, as well as comparison charts produced by competitors on their product information pages, to generate our list of competitors and identify the competitor best suited for deeper analysis.
   
   Once our competitor list was established, we conducted a detailed comparative analysis of three key insulin management devices: Omnipod 5, t: slim X2, and MiniMed 780G. We examined their functionality, usability, sensor accuracy, failure points, and integration with mobile apps. This analysis provided insights into market gaps, helping us understand how existing solutions handle insulin dosing, monitoring, and patient interaction.
   
   Our team conducted a heuristic evaluation on what we deemed, based on analysis of the product and features in comparison to planned features for our own product, to be our closest competitor: the Omnipod 5. Utilizing Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics, we scored the Omnipod 5 on a 1-10 scale for the following categories: Visibility of System Status; Match between system and the real world; User control and freedom; Consistency and standards; Error prevention; Recognition rather than recall; Flexibility and efficiency of use; Aesthetic and minimalist design; Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors; and Help and documentation. We then explained the reasoning behind our scoring for each of the criteria.

  
## Findings

1. Personas and Scenarios:
   Our findings revealed that different user groups have unique needs that are not fully addressed by existing insulin management solutions. Visually impaired users require voice-guided assistance and haptic feedback for better accessibility, while active individuals, such as athletes, need real-time insulin adjustments without manual intervention. Additionally, parents managing their child's diabetes seek remote monitoring capabilities with instant alerts to ensure timely intervention. Current devices lack seamless integration of these features, making diabetes management cumbersome for many users. By identifying these gaps, we ensured our solution incorporates automated insulin adjustments, accessibility enhancements, and intuitive remote monitoring, creating a more user-friendly, adaptable, and inclusive system for effective diabetes management.
2. Competitive Analysis:
    Our findings highlighted that while current devices effectively manage insulin delivery, they often lack personalization and seamless integration with digital health support tools, which are crucial for helping patients manage their insulin levels more effectively. Additionally, we examined cost-related barriers and accessibility challenges, ensuring our system provides a more affordable and user-friendly alternative. This helped us pinpoint areas where innovation is needed, shaping the direction of our solution towards a more personalized, AI-enhanced system for Type 2 diabetes management.
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Our heuristic evaluation identified the following heuristic categories as pain points (scored 7 or lower out of 10) for the Omnipod 5: User control and freedom; Consistency and standards; Error prevention; and Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. For the remaining categories, the Omnipod 5 scored 8 or higher.

## Conclusions

1. Personas and Scenarios:
   From the personas and scenarios, we discovered that users require personalized and adaptable insulin management solutions that fit seamlessly into their daily lives. Visually impaired users need voice-guided navigation and haptic feedback, active individuals benefit from real-time insulin adjustments without manual intervention, and parents managing a child’s diabetes require remote monitoring with instant alerts for added peace of mind. These findings emphasize the importance of accessibility, automation, and intuitive remote tracking in UX design. Future designs should prioritize clear voice interfaces, smartwatch integration, and simplified app navigation to accommodate diverse user needs.
2. Competitive Analysis:
   Our competitive analysis highlighted that while existing insulin pumps efficiently deliver insulin, they lack seamless digital health integration and customization. High costs, complex interfaces, and limited automation features create barriers for users. To address these shortcomings, our design should focus on a more affordable, AI-enhanced system that integrates real-time data monitoring, automated insulin adjustments, and user-friendly interfaces. By reducing manual interactions and cognitive load, we ensure that insulin management becomes effortless, intuitive, and personalized, ultimately improving user experience and adherence to treatment.
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Based on our heuristic evaluation of the Omnipod 5, we can see that our target users currently struggle with a product that has limited user control and freedom, and a product that has subpar error prevention and error recovery. To this end, we know that we are likely to develop a more appealing product if we take extra care in addressing error prevention and error recovery within the application.

## Caveats

1. Personas and Scenarios:
  Our personas and scenarios were not data-driven, and thus have some limitations in how much they may be representative of actual subsets of potential users. 
2. Competitive Analysis:
   Our research primarily relied on publicly available product information, user reviews, and manufacturer specifications, which may not fully capture real-world usability issues experienced by long-term users. Additionally, our analysis was constrained by the availability of direct user feedback, as we did not conduct hands-on testing of each device. Future research should include direct user testing, interviews with healthcare professionals, and hands-on evaluations to validate our findings and refine our design recommendations.
3. Heuristic Evaluation:
   Our heuristic evaluation competitor was chosen from a shortlist that our team generated based on our, admittedly limited, prior knowledge of diabetes management devices, as well as extrapolated from competitor comparisons provided by some of our identified competitors. With no direct access to an Omnipod 5 for working with it to better understand it, our heuristic evaluation was based on what we could gather from product pages and some Google-based research into product reviews and user-identified pain points mentioned in product reviews.
